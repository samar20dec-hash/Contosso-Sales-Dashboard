‚Ä¢ **Business Problem**
Contosso, a global enterprise, needs a consolidated view of its financial performance to quickly assess profitability, identify high-performing areas, and pinpoint potential issues. Without an integrated dashboard, answering critical questions such as:
- What are the monthly and quarterly profit trends?
- Which product brands are driving year-over-year growth?
- How do sales and profits vary across different continents or regions?
- What is the overall net profit after accounting for discounts and returns?
... becomes a time-consuming and complex task involving multiple data sources and manual aggregation.

- Provides a real-time overview of Contoso's key financial metrics.
- Enables users to drill down into performance by various dimensions (time, product, geography).
- Supports strategic decisions related to sales, marketing, product development, and regional operations.
- Uncovers trends and anomalies in financial data to facilitate proactive management.
